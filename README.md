# Facial Recog

## Inspiration
Facial recognition is nice, but often can be inaccurate for different faces. Would like to accurately be able to find the features of a face with rapid relocation.

## What it does
Finds your face, decides who you are, and can overlay images on your face.

## How I built it
A little bit of machine learning, some numpy, scipy, opencv, and a bunch of secret sauce.

## Challenges I ran into
Training the machine learning algorythm. Finding nice samples of faces that covered a broad spectrum of face types was a challenge. (I used the organizers faces)!

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Making myself look like batman. Keeping a history of the different locations the features have been found in order to stabilize the tracking software as changes should happen gradually, as opposed to drastic changes.

## What I learned
How to integrate many different open source libraries to optimize 

## What's next for Domecast
Mars, maybe relocating animals. Deciding if an animal has previously been found. I like to be friends with animals.
